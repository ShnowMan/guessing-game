    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img class="abc"src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11109010_10104137484674448_5058711764111809684_n.jpg?oh=9e71e0b3fb84354470897736ffb79230&oe=583468DA"
    <p>I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. I started cooking at a young age and always liked to please people <br>
      which has taken me very far into the hospitality industry, however it is time for a change. <br>
      I am now taking Code 201 from Code Fellows to augment my education and make it possible to change careers.</p>
    <p>Most recently I have been employed by the University of Washington since 2012 in a variety of positions, <br>
      finally landing with the working title Sous Chef or Manager of Program Operations.<br>
      Before the UW i was with El Gaucho Bellevue for a year as the Private Dining and Catering Chef. <br>
      My work home before El Gaucho was Tutta Bella as a pizziola and before that i spent a year at Wing Dome as the kitchen Manager<br>
      Early in my career i spent 5 years at Casa D's Taqueria as the Lead Cook and eventually Assistant Manager.
